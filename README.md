# Developing-In-house-Application---HelpDesk-System
In this project I worked as a Software Engineer to develop a Help Desk system aims to manage the technical inquiries submitted by  users to the IT help desk system for a University includes 3 campuses, 11 colleges, and 10,000 active students.

# Project Objectives: 
•	To provide a utility for the Helpdesk users that assigns their requests to the available PC Techs automatically.
•	To generate reports of helpdesk requests and progress of PC Techs.
•	To provide a utility for PC Tech to be notified with the new requests and the requestor details (Ext, page).
